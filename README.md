This code aims at analyzing stacks (time stacks) of droplet microscopy images. It performs:
i) extraction of droplet fluorescence and XY coordinate from multiple microscopy frames
ii) tracking of the droplets for reconstructing the time traces
iii) analysis of the amplification time traces and disctribution

Input data are under the form of stacks of images. Each stack is an XY frame and contains all time points and optical configuration (fluorescence channels, brightfield)
